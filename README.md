# iot-blockchain

This is the accompanying code of a draft publication which documents a flexible vanilla blockchain as a lightweight attachment to IoT devices. The system embeds a policy manager which defines and regulates the permissions required for authorised transactions, amendable only by one master device. The system is demonstrated inside an artificial network which simulates activity between multiple IoT devices, each of varying capability (a core consideration throughout the design of this system).
